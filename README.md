<h1>The MVP</h1>
Align's solution is designed to add value to large enterprise sales teams with dedicated enablement functions - this is our beachhead, and we need to prepare our MVP accordingly.

These firms require a significant degree of polish before considering signing contracts - they need assurance that their data is secure, that we will provide uptime, and most importantly, they need to feel like Align is the most premium solution on the market.

To be considered minimally viable, we have to be certified SOC2 compliant, build our core integrations, and be listed on the Okta Integration network, Salesforce AppExchange, the Chrome Web Store, and the Slack App store. This comes after our core functionalities are frictionless (CRUD cats, tags, messages, tagsOnMessages)
